#given a name and domain, predict an email address
#four patterns possible: first.last, f.last, first.l, f.l

#create a class which stores a hash of companies to patterns
#write two methods, produce_email(name, company) and update_pattern(company, pattern)

#patterns can also be stored and be represented by numbers
#produce_email will return either an array of four addresses, one address, or nothing
