Email-Predictor
===============

A ruby program to predict the email address of an employee at a given company. Supplemented with Rspec tests.

##Dependencies
The only gem needed is that ultra sexy rspec. 
```bash
gem install rspec
```

## Directions
Running the predictor_interface.rb file from the root directory should start the program.
```bash
ruby lib/predictor_interface.rb
```
Once started, just follow the prompts! First enter a full name, then the domain.
```bash
Enter a name to predict an email (ex. 'kiran surdhar'):
ricky bobby
Now enter a domain (ex. 'alphasights.com'):
talladega.com
```
